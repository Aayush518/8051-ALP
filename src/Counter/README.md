## 8051 Counting Sequence Program!

### How It Works

Imagine you have an 8051 microcontroller connected to a display (like an LED display) where you want to show a counting sequence from 0 to 9. This program does just that!

1. **Initialization**: 
   - We start by setting up the display to show the digit 0.

2. **Counting Loop**:
   - Next, we enter a loop where we:
     - Display digits from 0 to 9 sequentially.
     - Pause briefly after each digit change so you can see the numbers counting up.

3. **Delay Subroutine**:
   - To introduce a delay, we've created a small subroutine.
   - It's like a mini-program within our main program.
   - This subroutine cleverly uses loops to create a pause between each digit change.

4. **Repeat**:
   - Once we reach 9, we start over again at 0.
   - The counting sequence loops endlessly, so you can watch it as long as you'd like!

### Using the Program

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Code**:
   - Use an assembler compatible with the 8051 microcontroller to compile the provided assembly code.

2. **Upload to Microcontroller**:
   - Upload the compiled binary file to your 8051 microcontroller.

3. **Run the Program**:
   - Start the program on your microcontroller.

4. **Watch the Display**:
   - Enjoy watching the numbers count up from 0 to 9 and repeat the sequence!

### Customization

Feel free to customize the code:

- **Adjust Timing**: Modify the delay subroutine to change how long each digit appears before moving to the next one.
- **Change Hardware Setup**: If your display is connected to different pins or uses a different protocol, adjust the code accordingly.

### Compatibility

This code is specifically designed for the 8051 microcontroller architecture. It may need modifications to work with other microcontrollers.
